# ImageProvider
The easiest way to gather images from camera, gallery, etc.
Retrieve images from camera or gallery without all the boilerplate required (declaring FileProviders, Activtiy result management, bitmap conversion, etc.)

## Installation

ImageProvider is available in the Maven Central, so you just need to add it as a dependency
```groovy
implementation 'io.github.imablanco:imageprovider:{latest version}'
```

## Usage 

Using ImageProvider is super simple, just choose the source to pick the image from and the library will do all the stuff behind the scenes for you

Pick images from Camera:

```kotlin
ImageProvider(activity).getImage(ImageSource.CAMERA){ bitmap -> 
            //do stuff
        }       
```

Or from device gallery

```kotlin
ImageProvider(activity).getImage(ImageSource.GALLERY){ bitmap -> 
            //do stuff
        }
            
```

That's all!

### Note

Camera permissions request is beyond the scope of this library, so make sure you have the appropiated permissions granted before calling any methods.
